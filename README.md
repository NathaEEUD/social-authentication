# Social Authentication

Sometimes is easier to manage the authentication of our users via another service like Facebook or Twitter. Doing this it's not only even easier, it's also safer and it will let you focus in the most funny parts of your project. Also think about the users, they don't want to remember another username and another passworw for another platform.

In this repo you'll find the source code of a tutorial posted for me in [Platzi.com](https://platzi.com/blog) in which it's instructed how to build from scratch a social login using Django and Python Social Auth.

## Installation

* Install all the packages with:

	```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

* Add your private keys on the **settings.py** file.

* Run the project with:

	```$ python manage.py runserver```

* Enjoy!
